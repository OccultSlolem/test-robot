# test-robot
A set of example scripts for an FRC robot.

All the scripts that actually do stuff are down the src folder.

**Warning: This repo has not been maintained for a long time.** This was literally my very first foray into FRC programming. Most of the API has probably been updated, and I would advise you to look to those rather than reference this particular repo. I only leave it here for archival purposes.
